## Mixpanel
- Post our December release, we planned to use MixPanel to collect and study product analytics. 
- We used the MixPanel dashboard to track a few important KPIs which tied to the goals of our company. 
- The KPIs we tracked were
	- No. of searches done each week
	- No of posted/vacant/managed properties on the platform
	- 7-, and 30-Day User Retention

## Zoom sessions
- To get more qualitative insights I would constantly get on zoom calls with our users.
- Since the app had recently launched and none of our customers had used a mobile app of this sorts before, these sessions started with a tour of the apps features.
- The insights from these zoom sessions were used to curate the backlog or would go into our CMS system in the form of FAQs.
