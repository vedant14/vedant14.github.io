## Homzhub Team
At Homzhub, our tech team consisted of a CTO, a senior QA, a handful of devs and me. I was the product owner/manager. However though, before the start of the project, the lead developer had quit our team. 

## Outsourcing
A growing startup with a small team, we did not want to wait any longer to launch the product. The company decided to hire a tech-agency to deliver the app.

## Sharing of work
This was how the share of work happened between Homzhub and the tech agency - 
- Homzhub took care of 
	- writing the specs, 
	- creating a backlog of stories and 
	- prioritising them in the sprint cycle. 
	- created the data model diagrams for the app. 
	- worked with a designer to create high-fidelity designs. 
- The tech-agency provided a team of 6 devs, 1 designer and 1 project manager who 
	- worked inside the sprint cycle to develop the functionalities of the application.
