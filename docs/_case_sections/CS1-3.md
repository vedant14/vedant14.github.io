## Deciding Scope

	- Adding Property
	- Listing and Search
	- Site visits and Offers
- Additional features we wanted to build
	- Comprehensive ticket management flow
	- Breaking units and renting them individually
	- Providing analytics to the property owner to make the right buy/sell decisions

## Competitive Research
- Across India and globally we researched the various competitors in this space
- NestAway, NoBroker and Zenify were the bigger names, whilst, globally we had Buildium, HappyGo, etc.

## Usability Testing
- Homzhub had been operational for more than 2 years before we decided the plan for the app. In those two years, we had managed over 200 properties. These property owners were our first sample set for performing market research
-  We used WhatsApp messages, google forms with embedded videos of a XD prototype and zoom calls to gather feedback. 
-  To incentivise and get more feedback we gave away amazon gift coupons to the clients who agreed to provide us with a feedback.
