## Homzhub
- Homzhub is a prop-tech startup, founded in 2017. On a mission to make life stress-free for real estate investors, particularly for property owners with properties in more than one geographic locations. Homzhub provides services like assisted renting and property management to its clients. 
- Homzhubâ€™s first web-platform was launched in February, 2018. The objective at that time was to provide a reporting dashboard to the owners so that they can get real-time updates about how Homzhub had been managing their property.

## Why the new product
- We wanted to go one step further than a reporting tool. There was an opportunity to create a **SaaS platform** to tap the need of a growing market segment in India and globally. *We decided to take it.* 
- The initial web-platform was a proof of concept and the underlying tech was not robust enough to handle a SaaS architecture, so we decided to build our new application from ground up. 

## Objectives for the app
- Create an additional revenue stream for Homzhub
- Shift from a service company to a SaaS company
- Scale quickly to more cities in India and in future globally. 

## Timeline
- The project initiated in May 2020. 
- Private beta released in November 2020. 
- First official release in January 2021. 
- This case-study covers the journey till the first official release.
