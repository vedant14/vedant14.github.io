  content: <p>I have always been fascinated by startups and couldn't wait to join one. I joined Homzhub, only after a month of its founding. </p>
    <p> We were a very small team of 4 and I wasn't sure which was the right path for my career so I took part in all activities of the company - business operations, strategising, customer support, product management, marketing, hiring too.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I realised I liked being a <a href="https://twitter.com/paraschopra/status/1206273650422251520" target="_blank">generalist</a> and making products.</p>

    <p>With my team at Homzhub, <underline>we have launched our web-platform and 2 mobile apps</underline> for property investors and managers around the world.</p>
    <p>I have also created several no-code tools for our team to use to serve our 250+ clients.</p>
    <p>I have launched a few solo-products as well. You will learn about some of those below.</p>

    <p>Without a doubt, one of the most important experiences of my life - my journey with <a href="https://makeadiff.in">Make A Difference</a>.</p> 
    <p>I worked with some of the best youth across 24 cities in the country. I learned so much from being part of such an amazing team working towards a common cause that <underline>I really wonâ€™t be able to put into words.</underline></p>
    <p>I think it is safe to say, I got more out of volunteering my time at this non-profit than I could ever hope to repay. </p>

  content: To me writing is very important. I think when I write. <br>
    When I started working as a product manager, I wanted to learn as much about it as possible.
    <p>Fortunately, there isn't any lack of material online for PMs to learn. But that also meant that you could get lost in different ideologies and never learn anything valuable.</p>
    <p> So that is why I created <a href="http://www.betterproductmanager.com/" target="_blank">Better Product Manager</a>, <underline>to document my own learnings</underline>.</p>

  content: I wanted to try and execute a few ideas of my own. I tried to create a <a href="https://github.com/vedant14/realEstate" target="_blank">custom CRM for real estate agents.</a><br>
    <underline>I used to call hundereds of agents everyday</underline>, scrapping numbers from lisitng sites.<br>A few were interested but then because this was also my first code project, it wasn't a big enough value addition for them.<br> All in, it was still great exposure and learning experience for me.<br>
      Once, me and a group of my friends also tried to launch an under-wear company which never saw the light of the day

  content: <p>I wanted to improve my coding skills and test myself on a few real world projects. And working in customer support taught me one thing, <underline>an angry customer is a powerful motivating factor</underline>.<br> I also wanted to buy a new cycle. </p>
    So, I tried my hand at freelancing. Tbh, freelancing isn't as easy as people picture it to be.
    At several points during the project, I felt that I bit more than I could chew.

    Anyway, I got to build a car here, <underline>an actual human-size car!</underline><br> So no-complaints
