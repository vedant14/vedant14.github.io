My spent my weekdays as a Product Owner at Homzhub.\
I was hire no. 2 at this startup, starting our entrepreneurial journey from a small desk, which was still too big for our small team.\

# Projects


### [Trendy Turn](https://www.trendyturn.com){:target="_blank"}

<span class="caption">[2020]</span>\
This ecom website was my first freelance expirement. TBH, several points during the project,<span class="underline"> I felt that I bit more
than I could chew</span>. But I managed to scrap through a pretty respectable
web-app in the end.

### [Better Product Manager](http://www.betterproductmanager.com){:target="_blank"}

<span class="caption">[2019]</span>
When I started working as a product manager, I wanted to learn as much
about it as possible. Fortunately, there isn't any lack of material
online for PMs to learn. But that also meant, that you could get lost in
different idealogies and never learn anything valuable. So that is why I
created "better product manager". To document my own learnings really.
<span class="underline">I promise to write more frequently :P </span>

### [Real Estate CRM](https://realestatelistingapp.herokuapp.com){:target="_blank"}
<span class="caption">[2019]</span>\
The first website, I built from code I wrote. It felt empowering, because
you are literally creating something that did not exist before by simply
writing words.\
<span class="underline strong"> Isn't that magic?</span>
