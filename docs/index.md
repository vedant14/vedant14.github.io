 My Journey
At my startup, we are going to start a new sprint cycle from next Wednesday and I am worried. Good worried. I think this is how a rockstar might feel when he is about to step on the stage. Yep, this is my stage to shine. To ease my nerves I decided to do a quick revision - What is the role of a Product manager in the scrum process?

Important to note - Some teams have a product owner who takes part in the scrum. But we are a small team so there is no product owner. 

I have divided this post in two parts - the preparation and the during the sprint part. This post will cover all the things I have ‘marked done’ in the days leading up to this sprint cycle. 
 
## First of all - Why do I want a revision?
Because, this sprint is unlike all the other sprints that I have done in the past couple of years -
- First, this is my first real sprint as a full-time product manager. All the times before, this I was wearing a few other hats as well since we were a small team. But now this is my only priority. 
- Second, this is my first mobile product. We are launching a new product for the desktop and mobile version. So yep lots of new uncharted territory. 
- Third, we are also adding a SaaS component to it. So that complicates the decisions a bit - you have to decide how narrow or broad do you want it to go with every feature. 
- Lastly, well I just really want this to go well. I have invested a lot in this new product mentally and [time-wise](http://www.betterproductmanager.com/day-in-life-of-product-manager/). 

## Let’s start with where I am at until now. 
I wanted to make a list of all the things completed until now. This should give me a good dose of confidence and serve as a good [checklist](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owners-checklist-for-the-first-sprint-in-scrum/)  to return back to.
Here goes the list -

### Product Vision - Done
We know what problems we want to solve and the people we want to build it for. We did our research and spoke to individuals from our target group to ensure this is a problem they would like solved. We tried to find out if this was a “good to have” solution or “a must have”. If the solution is “good to have” then there is less possibility that your users will want to pay you to use it. 

### User personas - Done
There is one for each user group we are targeting. We conducted user interviews to collect enough data to generate them. [Read about it here](http://www.betterproductmanager.com/how-to-make-user-persona-for-your-first-product/).  We also keep going back to these users as and when we have something new to show them. This way our **stakeholders are invested in the process**. 

### The concept and the business model - Done
Well, much like any other step in this list, done does not mean set in stone. Using our research we imagined how the basic application would look like. And obviously how will we earn from this product. 

### Product themes and function maps - Done
We mapped out the main themes (or use cases) of the product and also the major functions inside them. I do them on my [airtable template](http://www.betterproductmanager.com/i-use-airtable-to-make-user-stories/). Main functions are the epics that I create in that example. 
 
### Definition of scope and MVP - Done
You can never build all the features you want in a single development cycle. And you shouldn’t. By targeting that you make your development process much more rigid. The fundamental advantage of agile over waterfall is that agile allows teams to keep their scope flexible. Do not squander this advantage by trying to build everything at once. \
I believe this is where the concept of a [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) emerged from. MVP stands for minimum viable product. The idea is to release a MVP to get feedback from users early on and then iterate quickly. No amount of research can substitute the reaction you get when the users actually use your product for the first time. For that reason, releasing an MVP is a crucial step. 

### Roadmap and release plan - Done
We sketched out a timeline for how the product would evolve (roadmap) with subsequent releases(release plan). We decided all our sprints would be two weeks long. And the definition of done will be that all stories are tested and released to our server. 
Which meant that we would follow a bi-weekly release plan i.e we shall make a new release at the end of each sprint. 

### Building Backlog - Done
We now know what our product vision is. We also know what are our main product features and the scope of the current build. Using these as the input I wrote user stories. I already mentioned [here](http://www.betterproductmanager.com/i-use-airtable-to-make-user-stories/), how useful these user stories have been for me. User stories are small and are easy enough for the entire team to understand. 
There are two more important steps in building backlog. 

### Story point estimation - Done
This is the second part of building backlog and here you would need the help of the scrum master. Story point estimation is a relative estimation for the effort required to deliver each user story. The scrum master discusses this with the team and assigns the story points to each individual story item. As a product manager your role is to clarify the queries the team has, if and when the arise relating to the product vision or user stories.

### Wireframes, Prototype, Final Designs - Done 
Yes, we did not include UX inside our sprints. The scrum process doesn’t really bode well for UX related activities. So we decided to initiate UX process a few weeks before the kick off of our sprint cycles. ‘No scrum’ is no problem as long as you still go with the agile mindset, and we did that. You’ll see.
We made wireframes to envision how the functions would look on the screen. These wireframes were then optimised and converted into prototypes. We conducted some user tests before we started to finalise the designs. So, we relied on actual user feedback even in our UX process. The designs are still subject to change as we move along the sprints, but it is nice to get a head start here. 



That’s it. That is my preparation going into this new sprint cycle. It feels nice to actually note all this down. Now, I am slightly more confident. Yes. 
Do you think I should do something else too? What are your thoughts? 
Do share them with me in the comments below. 
Thanks. Hope you are having a nice day.
