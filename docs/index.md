# Work
### [Homzhub](https://www.homzhub.com){:target="_blank"}
<span class="caption">[2017 - present]</span>\
I was hire no. 2 at this startup, when all of us used to sit and work from a small desk. Which was still too big for our small team then.\
In these 3 years, we have grown to a <span class="underline"> team of 20, with offices in two cities and clients in 7+ countries, and have launched a website and two mobile apps.</span>

# Side Projects

### [Trendy Turn](https://www.trendyturn.com){:target="_blank"}
<span class="caption">[2020]</span>\
This ecom website was my first freelance expirement. TBH, at several points during the project,<span class="underline"> I felt that I bit more
than I could chew</span>. But I managed to scrap through a pretty respectable
web-app in the end.

### [Better Product Manager](http://www.betterproductmanager.com){:target="_blank"}

<span class="caption">[2019]</span>
When I started working as a product manager, I wanted to learn as much
about it as possible. Fortunately, there isn't any lack of material
online for PMs to learn. But that also meant, that you could get lost in
different idealogies and never learn anything valuable. So that is why I
created "better product manager". <span class="underline">To document my own learnings really.</span>

### [Real Estate CRM](https://realestatelistingapp.herokuapp.com){:target="_blank"}
<span class="caption">[2019]</span>\
The first website, I built from code I wrote (Ruby on rails, if you're curious). It felt empowering, because
you are literally creating something that did not exist before by simply
writing words.\
<span class="underline strong"> Isn't that magic?</span>

# Semi-interesting facts
### [Volunteer at Make A Difference](https://makeadiff.in/){:target="_blank"}
<span class="caption">[2015-2019]</span>\
Make a Difference is an award winning non-profit that mobilizes young leaders to ensure equitable outcomes for children in shelters. As of today Make a Difference works with nearly 5000 children living in approximately 80 shelter homes in 23 cities across India. Make A Difference's team of more than 4000 Fellows, mentors and teachers deliver a holistic range of interventions aimed at helping children in shelters break the poverty cycle and flourish despite the circumstances they face.

I was the <span class="underline">Human Capital City Manager</span>, which meant I was responsible for hiring, training and mobilising the 150 volunteers of my city.

### [Reader](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80750798-vedant?shelf=read&view=table){:target="_blank"}
You may check my goodreads account in the link (not an exhaustive list
of books I've read). I've
been using that lately to keep a track of my reading lists, only because
how low maintenance it is compared to a dedicated notion page or building
a page on this jekyll. <span class="underline"> Do you have book
recommendations for me?</span>

### [Personal Blog](https://vedantlohbare.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}
<span class="caption">[2016-present]</span>\
I created this a very long time ago. I still intend to publish more
things here but the older I get the more weirder it feels to propogate
my weird beliefs to the whole world. I still write, almost every single
day, but none of it seems worthy to share on the site. Maybe
[2016-present] part motivates me enough to post a bit more frequently.
<span class="underline">Most of the posts are very personal, so please judge accordingly. </span>

### Under-graduate Engineer
<span class="caption">[2013-2017]</span>\
Well. If you are an Indian with a knack for maths, you will invariably
find yourself in an engineering school at some point of your life. This
is a non-negotiable treaty that we signed with our parents I suppose.
Anyway, I got to <span class="underline">build a car here </span>, an actual human-size car! So no-complaints.
