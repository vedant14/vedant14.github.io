## Background
<hr>
### Homzhub and the existing platform

At the time, it had been an year since we had launched our online platform. The platform had seen some traction, but most of our clients still preferred to use whatsapp to communicate with our operations team for resolving queries or to request data. 

### Our Team
Homzhub's product team had recently grown - we had hired our first CPO and a team of young developers. However though, before the start of the project, the lead developer quit our team. The junior developers left in the coming months before the project was formally initiated. Our CEO decided we could not delay the project any further and so, we decided to outsource the development of the app. 

### Outsourcing
In Homzhub team, we still had a CPO, a quality tester and me. We interviewed a few top firms and formalised the agreement with the team of NineLeaps to build our mobile apps. 

## My role
### During the planning phase
- Worked with the CEO to make the product roadmap, PRD and the current scope for the MVP.
- Participated in the process to finalise the vendor partner i.e NineLeaps to build the app.
- Created the initial set of user personas. 
- Designed rough wire-frames using figma to map out the user journey in various flows. 
- Used the mock prototype from figma to conduct usability tests over zoom call (because of the pandemic could not meet the users' in-person). 

### During the sprints
- Worked closely with the designers to simplify the user onboarding process and attain the desired user adoption goal.
- Estimated the relase cycle dates. 
- Created user-stories and maintained backlog 
- Helped the developers understand the use-case whenever there was an un-certainity. 
- Worked with the tech team to come up with solutions that would work in the constraints we had. (My experience of coding really came handy in this)
- Acted as a reviewer or the QA to ensure a great experience. 
- Collected and filtered through the feedback from the initial set of alpha users, post the sprints. 
- Adjusted the features based on the feedback collected. 

### Private Beta Release
- Scheduled for end of october.
