        <p>Hello, I hope you are doing well. <br> Before you read further, I would like to say two things -</p>

        <ol>
        <li>I always find it hard to write about me - maybe because I can’t talk about 25 years of living in under 400 words.</li>
        <li>I like people who like to read (since you chose to read the long-bio version, I am assuming). So you’re already awesome in my view.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I am a product maker, writer, cycle-enthusiast and a bibliophile. I graduated as an <a href="#engineering graduate">engineer</a> and am <a href="#work">currently working</a> with Homzhub. </p>

        <p>I was starting my career at a company with a clean slate and since I hadn’t quite figured out what I wanted to do with my career yet, I intended to use this opportunity well. </p>

        <p>So, initially I took part in - business operations, strategising, customer support, product management, marketing, hiring too. </p>

        <p>Eventually, I realised I liked being a <a href="https://twitter.com/paraschopra/status/1206273650422251520" target="_blank">generalist</a>.</p>

        <p>And I also loved building <a href="#product-management">products</a>. Maybe, that is why at Homzhub, I finally settled on as a role of Product Manager. </p>

        <p>Perhaps an important event in my life that I should really talk about is my journey with <a href="#volunteer at make a difference">Make A Difference</a>. I worked with some of the best youth across 24 cities in the country. I learned so much from being part of such an amazing team working towards a common cause that I really won’t be able to put into words.<br>I think it is safe to say, I got more out of volunteering my time at this non-profit than I could ever hope to repay. </p>

        <p>I have tried to other things outside my 9 to 5 too (working at a startup is anything but that). I made an app for <a href="#failed projects">real estate agents</a> and I tried to launch an under-wear company which never saw the light of the day. I freelanced a bit, just to improve my coding skills. Working in customer support teaches you one thing, an angry customer is a powerful motivating factor. </p>

        <p>I also read quite a bit. I am amongst those who believe, reading great books is a cheat code to living. I read a lot of biographies and memoirs, when I was younger. These days I read on history a bit. Favourite book? - Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I don’t know why, it just is. </p>

        <p>That is it I think. About me in under 400 words. If you’ve read till here, I would like to thank you for taking interest in my story. Maybe you can <a href="mailto:vedant.lohbare@gmail.com?subject=Hi%2C%20I%20saw%20your%20site%20and%20thought%20I%20could%20connect.&amp;body=Hi%2C%20my%20name%20is" target="_blank">mail me</a>, I would surely like to connect with you. </p>
